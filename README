This project focuses on rendering using modern OpenGL and how light affects 
models. Rotations on the models can with left clicking and dragging, while 
translations occur with right clicking and dragging. Zooming into and out of the
scene occurs with the scroll wheel. I have implemented a rendering mode that shows
the affects of the Phong illumination model. This can be toggled with the 'n' key.
The different scenes and types of lights are explained below:

Key '1': Directional (rotating) light only. Use key '4' to toggle directional
	 light.
Key '2': Directional (rotating) light + point light. Use key '4' to toggle
	 directinal light.
Key '3': Directional (rotating) lgiht + spot light. Use key '4' to toggle
	 directional light.
Keys F1, F2, F3 switch between the different models.
